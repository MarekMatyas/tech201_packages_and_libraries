# Packages, modules and libraries

### 1. Libraries

Libraries are a chunk of code that you want to re-use (mostly methods and functions).

Let's look at quick example: 

``` 
from random import random
```
This imports library called random and the way we can test it is as follows:

``` 
print(random())
```

This prints out random float numbers.
